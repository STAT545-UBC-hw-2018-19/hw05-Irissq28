Hello and Welcome to the repository for STAT545A hw05.

For more informations about the assignment, please view the [assignment detail](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw05/hw05.html)

This repo contains four parts, which are focused on Factor and figure management. 
* Factor management    
* File I/O
* Visualization design
* Writing figures to file
* Challenge part

In this assignment, I applied the interactive plot, to preview the effect, I upload the gif version of the figure, if you want to try the magic of the interactive plot, please download the `.Rmd` file and run it in RStudio.

Here is an useful [link](https://giphy.com/create/gifmaker), I made my gif, it's very easy, only thing you need to do before uplaod is to record what you need to show by *screen recording (control + shift + 5 for Mac)*
